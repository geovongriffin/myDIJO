# dijo readme
Hi, I'm a junior software developer and I'm using Github to tinker with website and application development.
Starting out with the frontend stuff. Not doing much besides experimenting.

Things I enjoy: website design, fiction writing, and gaming. My work will definitely touch on these areas the deeper I get into it.
